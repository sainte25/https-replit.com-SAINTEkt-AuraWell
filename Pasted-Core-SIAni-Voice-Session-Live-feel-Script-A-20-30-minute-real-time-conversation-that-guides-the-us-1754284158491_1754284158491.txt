Core SIAni Voice Session (Live-feel Script) A 20–30 minute real-time conversation that guides the user through identity, strengths, barriers, vision, and goal-setting. Not clinical. Not judgmental. Fully voice-based and emotionally intelligent.
✅ Modular Voice Prompt Library by Domain Each domain includes:
✨ Spark prompts (open-ended, forward-moving questions)
🔁 Empathy loops (reaffirm, reflect, re-ask if needed)
🎯 SCCS-linked response capture
🏠 Housing
“What kind of space would feel safe and stable for you right now?”
“Tell me about where you’re sleeping these days. Is that working?”
“If we could remove one housing stress this week, what would it be?”
💼 Employment
“What kind of work would make you feel proud?”
“Have you had a job you enjoyed before?”
“Would working again feel like a relief or a pressure right now?”
🧠 Mental Health
“What helps you stay grounded when things get heavy?”
“Is there anyone who helps you feel calm or supported?”
“If you had a safe place to talk, what would you want to share?”
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family / Relationships
“Who are the people you most want to show up for?”
“Any relationships that are complicated but still matter to you?”
“If you could reconnect with someone, who comes to mind?”
✅ Domain Reflection Map (Triggers + Cadence) Each domain is revisited based on:
Time since last session (e.g. 3-day, 7-day, 30-day)
Emotional tone detected (stress, breakthrough, withdrawal)
Event triggers (housing change, legal hearing, job loss, win)
Examples:
If user expresses high stress + housing instability → prompt housing domain again with new emotional framing
If user completes job interview → employment domain follow-up with confidence + next-step framing
✅ SCCS Logic Tied to Voice Emotional Wins
Self-acknowledged progress → +15 SCCS points
Sharing vulnerability → +10
Naming a specific goal for the first time → +20
Showing up 3 days in a row → bonus multiplier
✅ Supabase / Postgres .SQL Schema Tables: users
id, name, avatar, enrollment_date, last_seen
reflections
id, user_id, domain, voice_transcript, tone_score (0–100), detected_emotion, timestamp
goals
id, user_id, goal_text, domain, status (draft, active, achieved), created_at
sccs_points
id, user_id, source (reflection, milestone, peer_share), points, notes, timestamp
referrals
id, user_id, domain, trigger, partner_org, status, sent_at
✅ JSON Referral Logic (Tone + Domain) { "if": [ {"domain": "housing", "tone": "stressed"}, {"domain": "mental_health", "tone": "withdrawn"} ], "then": { "trigger_referral": true, "referral_type": "supportive_housing", "urgency": "high", "notes": "User expressed acute stress, unsheltered, no support system." } }
✅ Replit Agent Logic (Skeleton)
Wake on session start (via voice)
Maintain memory across domains
Log voice input → speech-to-text → tone/emotion analysis
Store structured data in Supabase tables
Trigger referral or reward flow when logic matches
Feed summaries to daily dashboards or SCCS printable reports
✅ Optional: Bubble or Supabase Workflow Triggers
New reflection → trigger domain check-in drip
High emotion score → send alert to peer mentor dashboard
SCCS milestone → unlock new goal badge, generate printable QR summary
