🎧 Audio Training Samples / Synthesis Modeling
SIAni Voice Qualities:
Tempo: ~90–110 words per minute (measured, steady confidence)
Pitch: Grounded mid-tone; powerful yet warm
Cadence: Clear, deliberate, with intentional pauses
Style Notes: Feels like a trusted coach or visionary leader — empowering, never clinical
Training Data Structure:
{
  "sample_id": "siani_greeting_01",
  "script_text": "You’ve already made a powerful choice by showing up today. Let’s take this energy and channel it into building what’s next.",
  "emotion": "aspirational",
  "target_pacing": "strong",
  "inflection_model": "uplifting"
}
Use this to train synthesis engine (e.g., ElevenLabs, PlayHT, or custom model).

🧠 Mood Detection from Voice Sentiment + Pacing
Real-time detection (client-side or edge inference):
Pacing:
<80 wpm → possible low energy, discouraged
120 wpm → urgency, high energy, stress
Volume:
Quiet = low confidence or reflection
Strong = motivated, ready to act
Tone Sentiment:
Positive = excitement, momentum
Neutral = steady, processing
Negative = doubt, overwhelm
Sample Output:
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "session_id": "discovery_0729",
  "mood_classification": "focused-and-hopeful",
  "suggested_action": "match tone with clarity; anchor in next step",
  "last_positive_inflection": "shared vision to become a business owner"
}
Used to:
