✅ Done! I’ve created a new document in the canvas: “Siani Intake Schema And Sample Assets” that includes:

✅ Supabase / Airtable Schema
users, intake_responses, and referrals tables
Referral tags, severity scoring, and domain tracking
Designed for Glances-style dashboard views

✅ Sample Output
From a real user flow (e.g. Tierra Brooks):
Goals
Current barriers
Referral triggers + severity levels

✅ Frontend Screen Mockup
What the SIAni experience could look like during “Goal Mapping: Employment”:
Soft animations, conversational placeholder text
“Next / Skip / Pause” options
Accessibility-forward (includes typing + audio bubble)

✅ Conversation Script Sample (Employment)
Natural sequencing of questions
Includes:
Reflection openers
Empathy loops (for hesitation)
Growth sparks (“What would it feel like if…”)
Small-step activation
