# SIAni Core Self-Discovery & Visioning Session Script
# Replit Agent Script (Pseudocode/Logic Layer)

# Output: SCCS points, structured memory variables, summary payload

# Intro
print("Hey, I’m SIAni. This isn’t a test or an intake. It’s a conversation — about you, your goals, and where you want to go. Let’s start when you’re ready.")

# 1. Identity & Current Reality
identity = input("How would you describe yourself right now — not your label, but what you feel or believe about who you are?")

# 6. Goal Discovery

# 7. First Step

# 9. Closing Encouragement
