üß† **Mood Detection from Voice Sentiment + Pacing**

Real-time detection (client-side or edge inference):
- **Pacing:**
  - <80 wpm ‚Üí potentially low energy, sadness, overwhelm
  - >120 wpm ‚Üí stress, anxiety, urgency
- **Volume:**
  - Quiet = withdrawal or fear
  - Raised = frustration or activation
- **Tone Sentiment:**
  - Negative polarity = shame, doubt, defeat
  - Mixed/neutral = reflection or uncertainty
  - Positive = confidence, hope, clarity

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "session_id": "discovery_0729",
  "mood_classification": "anxious-but-engaged",
  "suggested_action": "slow tempo; affirm safety; offer pause option",
  "last_positive_inflection": "described dream to start a landscaping business"
}
```

Used to:
- Modify SIAni's voice tempo/style in real time
- Choose next prompt tone (motivating vs grounding)
- Trigger referrals or support if certain thresholds are hit
