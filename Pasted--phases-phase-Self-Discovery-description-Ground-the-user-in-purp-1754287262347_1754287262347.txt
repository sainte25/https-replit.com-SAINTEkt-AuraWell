✅ I've created a complete working draft of the conversational flow + backend schema for the SAINTE intake experience guided by SIAni. It’s now live in the canvas: "Siani Intake Conversation And Schema."
Here’s what’s included:
✅ Frontend Flow (SIAni-style)
Conversational prompts grouped by phases, not form sections
Reflective, growth-mindset tone
Language that feels like an exercise, not a system
✅ Backend Schema
Every prompt maps to a structured field
Responses can be saved as structured JSON
Referral logic can be layered on later via referral_tags
✅ Glances-Ready Output
You can present a dashboard view like:
Top goals across domains
Where they feel stuck
Support needed
Referral urgency
Contact preferences
