🧠 **Mood Detection from Voice Sentiment + Pacing**

Real-time detection:
- **Pacing:**
  - <80 wpm → may indicate fear, fatigue, overwhelm
  - >120 wpm → urgency, anxious energy
- **Volume:**
  - Soft = uncertainty, withdrawal
  - Raised = momentum, possible escalation
- **Tone Sentiment:**
  - Positive = motivation, hope
  - Neutral = curiosity, reflection
  - Negative = frustration, defeat, stress

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "session_id": "visioning_0831",
  "mood_classification": "hopeful_but_uncertain",
  "suggested_action": "affirm autonomy, offer achievable next step",
  "last_positive_inflection": "talked about going back to school for her kids"
}
```

🎙️ **Simulated Voice Session: SIAni Core Discovery Workshop**

**(Tone: aspirational, calm, grounded)**

> “Hey. I’ve got you. We’re not doing forms today — we’re building your future. You ready to dream a little with me?”

> “Let’s start with who you are — not just what you’ve been through. What’s your name? And what do you want to be known for?”

[Pause for voice input → backend tags: identity, tone, agency]

> “Okay. That matters. Now tell me — if you could wake up 90 days from now with one big win under your belt, what would it be?”

[Goal-setting block → backend stores timestamp, tone = determined, tag = ‘vision_goal_90d’]

> “Love it. What’s the first thing you think we could do to get a step closer? Nothing too big — just one move.”

[Small step logic → tags first action, builds confidence streak]

> “Now tell me what’s been making it hard. What’s real in your world that we need to work around, not ignore?”

[Barrier mapping → branches to housing, legal, stress, etc.]

> “I hear you. You’re not alone in this. I’ve seen people just like you move mountains — we just build one rock at a time.”

> “Can I ask you about a few areas — housing, health, work — and you just tell me where the heat is?”

[Modular transition to domain branching]

🧭 **Smart Domain Branching Map**

**Initial Trigger →** Identity + Goal → Tailored flow based on stated goals, tone, and risk level

| Domain | Trigger | Priority | Follow-Up Prompts | SCCS Tags |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Housing | Mentions unsheltered, unsafe, unstable | High | “Where did you sleep last night?” “What would feel like stability?” | `housing_urgency`, `safety_flag` |
| Employment | States goal as job, income, or independence | Med | “What kind of work excites you?” “Want help mapping your path?” | `work_ready`, `motivation_flag` |
| Mental Health | Tone = low/confused/anxious OR explicitly mentioned | High | “Want to talk through what’s been heavy?” “What helps you feel solid?” | `mh_support`, `resilience_win` |
| Legal | Supervision, fines, violations, fear of PO | Med-High | “Got any court stuff coming up?” “Want help understanding your status?” | `legal_active`, `trust_risk` |
| Parenting | Mentions kids, family goals | Med | “Want to be more present for them?” “What kind of parent do you want to be?” | `parenting_strength`, `purpose_anchor` |

Every branch maps:
- 🎧 Prompts → emotional tone → SCCS insight
- 🎯 Goal alignment + taskable items
- 🤝 Referral tag if threshold hit (see JSON logic below)
