Here’s how to build this so SIAni delivers a conversational coaching experience on the front end, while the backend captures structured data that feeds your Glances-style dashboard for staff and partner access.

🎯 What You’re Building
🔊 Frontend (SIAni’s UX):
Conversational flow that feels like a coaching/journaling exercise
Divided into four core phases:
Self-Discovery
Goal Mapping
Vision Activation
Support & Consent
User interacts through natural dialogue, not forms
💾 Backend (Structured Intake Data):
Stores every reflection, goal, and response as structured records
Auto-tags referral needs and urgency
Feeds Glances-style snapshot UI with:
“What’s their top goal?”
“What do they need now?”
“Who’s helping them?”
“Where are they stuck?”

🧠 Conversation-to-Data Model
Let’s take one domain as an example:
🎯 Example: Employment & Income (Phase 2: Goal Mapping)
SIAni says (frontend):
“Let’s talk about work—past, present, future.
What kind of work have you done before?
And what kind of job would light you up now, if anything was possible?”
(user answers)
“Got it. Are you looking for work right now?”
“Do you need tools, transportation, or maybe a resume?”
“Let’s map it—what’s one small step you could take this week?”

What gets stored (backend):
json
CopyEdit
{
  "domain": "employment",
  "responses": {
    "past_work": "landscaping and roofing",
    "dream_job": "own my own landscaping company",
    "currently_looking": true,
    "barriers": ["needs_tools", "no_resume"],
    "goal_30_days": "Apply for 2 contracts and get equipment support",
    "referral_tags": ["employment_support", "tools_needed", "resume_help"]
  }
}


What shows up in Glances UI:
Work: Wants to start landscaping biz.
30-Day Goal: Get 2 contracts + support with tools.
Barriers: No resume, needs gear.
Referral Sent: [Goodwill Tools Program] on Aug 5

🧩 Full Architecture (Simplified)
Layer
What it Does
SIAni UX
Conversational prompts + responses
Session Engine
Tracks phase, captures responses, handles skips & pauses
Storage Layer
Saves by domain (housing, legal, etc.) with metadata & tags
Rules Engine
Triggers referral alerts based on logic (“no housing” etc.)
Glances API
Summarizes key needs, goals, supports in one screen snapshot


🔄 Your Next Steps
Would you like me to generate:
 A Phase 1 conversation script with prompts + backend keys
 The JSON schema for all 16 intake categories mapped to conversational keys
 A Supabase or Airtable schema for storing the intake behind the scenes
 A sample Glances dashboard layout based on real user responses
Just say the word and I’ll build the next piece.
