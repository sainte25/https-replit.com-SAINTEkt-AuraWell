🛠️ Start completely fresh — no reused broken code. Build a voice-first, luxury AI wellness companion named SIANI, using the already-uploaded fonts, portrait, icons, and Supabase backend. Everything must be mobile-optimized and Apple-grade in polish and simplicity.
✅ Use ONLY the uploaded assets — do not generate or substitute images, fonts, or icons.
✅ The project is already connected to Supabase. Use it exclusively for ALL data operations.
✅ Use existing Supabase tables when possible — do not create duplicates.
🔧 CORE FEATURES (All Must Work):
1. ✅ Voice-Only AI Chat

Tap once to begin continuous conversation
Uses Web Speech API (or compatible voice tech)
No visible chat bubbles/text
SIANI portrait centered, pulsing glow when speaking
WEALTH font only for SIANI’s name
2. ✅ Mood Tracker + Insight Dashboard

User taps on mood SVG (from provided set)
Save mood entry to Supabase with user + timestamp
Show visual feedback (glow, animation)
Dashboard must include mood patterns over:
Week (7 days)
Month (calendar grid)
Quarter & Year (trend or bar charts)
Use only Supabase data for all mood displays
Mobile-first, glassmorphic UI
3. ✅ Daily Action & Reflection Flow

Each day: user enters 3 custom action steps
As they complete each, they check it off to earn points
At night: user is prompted to reflect on:
1 thing they’re grateful for
1 thing that went well
1 thing they’d improve and how
Store all data in Supabase under appropriate tables
Persisted by day, linked to user
4. ✅ Care Team System (Dynamic)

Show all assigned care team members in Support tab
When a user interacts with a resource (uses or rates it):
Add the corresponding org/person to the Care Team in Supabase
Include name, role, org, and date added
Data must be shown dynamically from Supabase only
5. ✅ Resource Engine + Rating System

Deliver user resources based on mood/goal context
Each resource must show:
Title, description, org, person, average rating, count
User can submit 1–5 star rating (+ optional short review)
Rating updates are stored in Supabase and update the average
When user rates a resource, auto-add that provider to Care Team
6. ✅ CHW Messaging Interface

1:1 secure chat with assigned Community Health Worker
Show timestamps, allow replies
Must use Supabase (real-time or polling)
Mobile-first, styled like SIANI voice UI
7. ✅ Calendar + Appointment Reminders

Show a calendar view (weekly/monthly)
Pull scheduled appointments or reminders from Supabase
Allow users to:
View upcoming events
Get reminder popups (e.g., “You have a session at 3PM”)
Add/update/delete appointments if permitted
Calendar must update in real time and match SIANI design
This calendar view is part of the "Schedule" tab in the nav bar
🔐 DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

Use only Supabase for all reads/writes
DO NOT use localStorage or browser-only persistence
Use existing Supabase tables wherever possible — no duplications
If a required table does not exist, create it with appropriate schema
All data (mood logs, action steps, reflections, ratings, care team, messages, appointments) must be stored, updated, and retrieved from Supabase
Errors must be gracefully handled and reported in-app
🎨 UI/UX RULES

Design must match Apple standards: minimal, glassmorphic, clean
Use uploaded portrait, font, icons only — no emojis or placeholders
All screens must be mobile-responsive and preview correctly inside and outside Replit browser
Every button and interaction must work — no dead UI elements

✅ Mood insights dashboard
✅ Daily steps + reflection
✅ CHW chat
✅ Resource rating + care team expansion
✅ Appointment calendar with Supabase events
