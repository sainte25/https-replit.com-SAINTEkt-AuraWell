üß† **Mood Detection from Voice Sentiment + Pacing**

Real-time detection (client-side or edge inference):
- **Pacing:**
  - <80 wpm ‚Üí potentially low energy, sadness, overwhelm
  - >120 wpm ‚Üí stress, anxiety, urgency
- **Volume:**
  - Quiet = withdrawal or fear
  - Raised = frustration or activation
- **Tone Sentiment:**
  - Negative polarity = shame, doubt, defeat
  - Mixed/neutral = reflection or uncertainty
  - Positive = confidence, hope, clarity

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "session_id": "discovery_0729",
  "mood_classification": "anxious-but-engaged",
  "suggested_action": "slow tempo; affirm safety; offer pause option",
  "last_positive_inflection": "described dream to start a landscaping business"
}
```

Used to:
- Modify SIAni's voice tempo/style in real time
- Choose next prompt tone (motivating vs grounding)
- Trigger referrals or support if certain thresholds are hit

üß≠ **Simulated Live Voice Session (Discovery Workshop Excerpt)**

> "Hey, welcome. You‚Äôve been through a lot to get here ‚Äî and I want to make this space feel like your own. This isn‚Äôt just a check-in. It‚Äôs a chance to reset, to dream, and to make a plan that actually fits you."

> "Let‚Äôs start with the big picture: What‚Äôs something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî you wish could feel different in your life 90 days from now?"

> "Okay‚Ä¶ that matters. Let‚Äôs keep going. What are three things, small or big, that you‚Äôve done in the past you‚Äôre proud of ‚Äî even if no one else noticed?"

> "You‚Äôve got more in you than you‚Äôve had a chance to show. So here‚Äôs the move: We‚Äôll look at where you‚Äôre at in life ‚Äî not to judge it, but to map out your path forward. I‚Äôll help you set goals, unlock support, and stay grounded along the way."

> "If you ever feel stuck during this, just say ‚Äòpause‚Äô or ‚Äònot ready.‚Äô You‚Äôre in control. Let‚Äôs start with housing ‚Äî where are you staying tonight?"

...

> "You said you‚Äôre bouncing between places and don‚Äôt always feel safe. That takes strength just to manage every day. I‚Äôm tagging this as a ‚Äòhousing stability flag.‚Äô I‚Äôll look for emergency options nearby and long-term fits."

...

> "Alright ‚Äî now let‚Äôs shift to your goals. If you could wake up 30 days from now having made one powerful move forward, what would it be?"

> "Let‚Äôs lock that in. That‚Äôs not just a dream ‚Äî that‚Äôs direction."
